# üìù Text Preprocessing with NLTK: A Beginner's Guide

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on text preprocessing with NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)! üöÄ This notebook will walk you through various essential text preprocessing techniques, explained in simple terms with easy-to-follow code examples. Whether you're just starting out in NLP (Natural Language Processing) or looking to brush up on your skills, you're in the right place!

NLTK provides a powerful suite of tools for processing and analyzing unstructured text data. Let‚Äôs dive into the essential preprocessing steps:

## 1. Tokenization

Tokenization splits text into individual words or sentences.

### Sentence Tokenization

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

text = "Hello World. This is NLTK. It is great for text processing."
sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
print("Sentence Tokenization:", sentences)
```

### Word Tokenization

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

words = word_tokenize(text)
print("Word Tokenization:", words)
```

## 2. Removing Stop Words

Stop words are common words that might not be useful for analysis (e.g., "is", "the", "and").

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
nltk.download('stopwords')

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_words = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in stop_words]
print("Filtered Words:", filtered_words)
```

## 3. Stemming

Stemming reduces words to their root form by chopping off the ends.

```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
stemmer = PorterStemmer()
stemmed_words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in filtered_words]
print("Stemmed Words:", stemmed_words)
```

## 4. Lemmatization

Lemmatization reduces words to their base form (lemma), considering the word‚Äôs meaning.

```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
nltk.download('wordnet')

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
lemmatized_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in filtered_words]
print("Lemmatized Words:", lemmatized_words)
```

## 5. Part-of-Speech Tagging

Tagging words with their parts of speech (POS) helps understand grammatical structure.

```python
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(lemmatized_words)
print("POS Tags:", pos_tags)
```

## 6. Named Entity Recognition

Identify named entities such as names of people, organizations, and locations.

```python
%pip install numpy

nltk.download('maxent_ne_chunker')
nltk.download('words')
from nltk.chunk import ne_chunk

named_entities = ne_chunk(pos_tags)
print("Named Entities:", named_entities)
```

## 7. Word Frequency Distribution

Count the frequency of each word in the text.

```python
from nltk.probability import FreqDist

freq_dist = FreqDist(lemmatized_words)
print("Most Common Words:", freq_dist.most_common(5))
```

## 8. Removing Punctuation

Remove punctuation from the text.

```python
import string

no_punct = [word for word in lemmatized_words if word not in string.punctuation]
print("Words Without Punctuation:", no_punct)
```

## 9. Lowercasing

Convert all words to lowercase.

```python
lowercased = [word.lower() for word in no_punct]
print("Lowercased Words:", lowercased)
```

## 10. Spelling Correction

Correct the spelling of words.

```python
%pip install pyspellchecker

from nltk.corpus import wordnet
from spellchecker import SpellChecker

spell = SpellChecker()

def correct_spelling(word):
    if not wordnet.synsets(word):
        return spell.correction(word)
    return word

lemmatized_words = ['hello', 'world', '.', 'klown', 'taxt', 'procass', '.']
words_with_corrected_spelling = [correct_spelling(word) for word in lemmatized_words]
print("Words with Corrected Spelling:", words_with_corrected_spelling)
```

## 11. Removing Numbers

Remove numerical values from the text.

```python
lemmatized_words = ['hello', 'world', '88', 'text', 'process', '.']

no_numbers = [word for word in lemmatized_words if not word.isdigit()]
print("Words Without Numbers:", no_numbers)
```

## 12. Word Replacement

Replace specific words with other words (e.g., slang with formal words).

```python
lemmatized_words = ['hello', 'world', 'gr8', 'text', 'NLTK', '.']
replacements = {'NLTK': 'Natural Language Toolkit', 'gr8': 'great'}

replaced_words = [replacements.get(word, word) for word in lemmatized_words]
print("Words with Replacements:", replaced_words)
```

## 13. Synonym Replacement

Replace words with their synonyms.

```python
from nltk.corpus import wordnet

lemmatized_words = ['hello', 'world', 'awesome', 'text', 'great', '.']

def get_synonym(word):
    synonyms = wordnet.synsets(word)
    if synonyms:
        return synonyms[0].lemmas()[0].name()
    return word

synonym_replaced = [get_synonym(word) for word in lemmatized_words]
print("Words with Synonyms:", synonym_replaced)
```

## 14. Extracting Bigrams and Trigrams

Extract bigrams (pairs of consecutive words) and trigrams (triplets of consecutive words).

```python
from nltk import bigrams, trigrams

bigrams_list = list(bigrams(lemmatized_words))
print("Bigrams:", bigrams_list)

trigrams_list = list(trigrams(lemmatized_words))
print("Trigrams:", trigrams_list)
```

## 15. Sentence Segmentation

Split text into sentences while considering abbreviations and other punctuation complexities.

```python
import nltk.data

text = 'Hello World. This is NLTK. It is great for text preprocessing.'

# Load the sentence tokenizer
tokenizer = nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')

# Tokenize the text into sentences
sentences = tokenizer.tokenize(text)

# Print the tokenized sentences
print("Segmented Sentences:", sentences)
```

## 16. Identifying Word Frequencies

Identify and display the frequency of words in a text.

```python
from nltk.probability import FreqDist

lemmatized_words = ['hello', 'hello', 'awesome', 'text', 'great', '.', '.', '.']

word_freq = FreqDist(lemmatized_words)
for word, freq in word_freq.items():
    print(f"{word}: {freq}")
```

## 17. Removing HTML Tags

Remove HTML tags from the text.

```python
%pip install bs4

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html_text = "<p>Hello World. This is NLTK.</p>"
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_text, "html.parser")
cleaned_text = soup.get_text()
print("Cleaned Text:", cleaned_text)
```

## 18. Detecting Language

Detect the language of the text.

```python
%pip install langdetect

from langdetect import detect

language = detect(text)
print("Detected Language:", language) # `en` (for English)
```

## 19. Tokenizing by Regular Expressions

Use Regular Expressions to tokenize text.

```python
text = 'Hello World. This is NLTK. It is great for text preprocessing.'

from nltk.tokenize import regexp_tokenize

pattern = r'\w+'
regex_tokens = regexp_tokenize(text, pattern)
print("Regex Tokens:", regex_tokens)
```

## 20. Remove Frequent Words

Remove frequent words (high-frequency words) from a list of tokens.

```python
import nltk

# Input text
text = "Natural language processing is a field of AI. I love AI."

# Tokenize the text
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)

# Calculate the frequency of each word
fdist = nltk.FreqDist(tokens)

# Remove the most common words (e.g., the top 10% by frequency)
filtered_tokens = [token for token in tokens if fdist[token] < fdist.N() * 0.1]

print("Tokens Without Frequent Words:", filtered_tokens)
```

## 21. Remove Extra Whitespace

Tokenize the input string into individual sentences and remove leading or trailing whitespace from each sentence.

```python
import nltk.data

# Text data
text = 'Hello World. This is NLTK. It is great for text preprocessing.'

# Load the sentence tokenizer
tokenizer = nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')

# Tokenize the text into sentences
sentences = tokenizer.tokenize(text)

# Remove extra whitespace from each sentence
sentences = [sentence.strip() for sentence in sentences]

# Print the tokenized sentences
print("Sentences Without Extra Whitespace:", sentences)
```
